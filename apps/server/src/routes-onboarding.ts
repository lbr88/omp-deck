 * Onboarding routes — drive the first-run wizard's state machine.
 *
 * GET  /api/onboarding/state          → OnboardingState (composite)
 * POST /api/onboarding/complete       → mark done (skipped flag distinguishes
 *                                       walked-through vs X-ed out)
 * POST /api/onboarding/seed-kb-system → write the four `system/*.md` stubs
 *                                       that the default `/start` body
 *                                       references; idempotent (won't
 *                                       overwrite existing files)
 *
 * Provider auth, kb init, start.md write, and env updates all reuse their
 * existing routes (`/api/auth/oauth/*`, `/api/kb/init`,
 * `/api/orientation/*`, `/api/env/*`). The wizard just sequences them.
