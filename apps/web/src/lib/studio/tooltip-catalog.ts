/**
 * Tooltip + context-menu catalog — the only persistent knowledge layer for
 * the studio. Both the tooltip singleton and the context-menu singleton
 * read from here. Versioning + drift handling lives in
 * `Tooltip.ts` (compare against `omp-deck:studio:catalog-version-seen`).
 *
 * v1 seeds (≥80 tooltip entries + ≥30 menu descriptors) come from:
 *   - every router path in apps/web/src/router.tsx
 *   - every KNOWN_TOOLS entry in packages/protocol/src/index.ts
 *   - every BridgeName + every NotificationLevel
 *   - every server route prefix inventoried in apps/server/src/routes*.ts
 *   - the top-of-file docblocks of every view file
 *   - the marketplace install/uninstall/dry-run call paths
 *
 * [STUDIO-SEED] marker list — every `data-tooltip-key` / `data-context-key`
 * the studio expects to find a non-empty entry for in `/studio` even when
 * the prose was sourced from a heuristic stub. The Tiptoop surface falls
 * through to the heuristic for any key missing here, but the studio's
 * hard floor is zero "unknown" hovers in /studio, so this list names
 * every element we know is mounted.
 *
 *   elements: gholam.sidebar, gholam.sidebar.start, gholam.sidebar.heartbeat,
 *             kanban.card, kanban.column, kanban.columns-edit,
 *             studio.pane.kb, studio.pane.composer, studio.pane.tasks,
 *             studio.pane.gholam, studio.pane.prompts,
 *             studio.statusbar.bridges, studio.statusbar.deploy,
 *             studio.statusbar.inbox, studio.statusbar.mcp,
 *             studio.statusbar.shortcut,
 *             chrome.nav-rail, chrome.connection, chrome.tool-cards,
 *             chrome.inspector, chrome.sidebar, gholam.priority.add,
 *             gholam.priority.remove
 *   context-keys: kanban.card, kanban.column, gholam.priority,
 *                 composer.attachment, kb.commit-graph.vertex, kb.file,
 *                 studio.statusbar.badge, bridge.telegram
 *
 * Bump TOOLTIP_CATALOG_VERSION on every add/remove/rewrite. The version
 * number is a single integer — clients compare strictly. A drift logs a
 * one-line console message; rendering never blocks.
